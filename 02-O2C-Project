# Order-to-Cash (O2C): Mixed Fulfillment & Business Exceptions

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a high-complexity **Order-to-Cash (O2C)** cycle within Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. The scenario goes beyond a standard "Happy Path" to showcase how a Functional Consultant handles real-world business hurdles such as partial payments and sales returns.

### 🏢 Client Scenario: Dublin Office Solutions
* **The Deal:** A sale of 5x ATHENS Desks plus 5 hours of professional 'Office Setup' services.
* **The Complexity:** 1. **Service vs. Product:** Managing inventory items alongside non-stock service hours.
    2. **Partial Payment:** Handling a cash flow scenario where the customer pays a round sum (£2,000) against a larger invoice.
    3. **Sales Return:** Processing a 'Damaged in Transit' return for 1 unit and issuing a corresponding Credit Memo.

## 🛠 Step-by-Step Execution

### Step 1: Master Data & Item Configuration
Configured a **Service-Type Item** to ensure labor costs are tracked without affecting warehouse inventory counts.

### Step 2: Sales Order Processing
Converted a Quote into a Firm Sales Order. The order was **Released** to signal the warehouse team for picking and shipping.

### Step 3: Logistics & Fulfillment
Executed the **Post Shipment** function. This reduced the inventory of physical desks while keeping the service lines open for final billing.

### Step 4: Revenue Recognition (Invoicing)
Generated the final **Posted Sales Invoice**. This document serves as the legal demand for payment and recognizes revenue in the General Ledger.

### Step 5: Partial Cash Receipt
Managed a partial payment of **£2,000.00**. This demonstrates the ability to manage **Accounts Receivable (AR)** and apply cash to specific open invoices.

### Step 6: Handling Sales Returns
The customer reported 1 damaged unit. I utilized the **'Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse'** feature to create a Sales Return Order, ensuring 100% audit traceability.

### Step 7: Credit Memo Issuance
Posted the Return to generate a **Sales Credit Memo**, which automatically adjusted the customer's outstanding debt.

### Step 8: Final Financial Reconciliation
The final "Single Source of Truth." The Customer Ledger Entries now reflect the initial debt, the partial payment, and the return adjustment, showing a verified net balance.
